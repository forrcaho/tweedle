Tweedle split keyboard

The Tweedle is a 60 to 62-key split columnar-staggered keyboard with extra dedicated keys to mkae the transition from a normal to split keyboard easier. The Tweedle also works with many widely-available keycap sets. The Tweedle is powered by QMK using Adafruit's Kee Boar Driver (KB2040) with the Raspberry Pi RP2040. Normal keys can be used in lieu of the encoders if desired.
